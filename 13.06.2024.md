# Day 2

Today I learned a lot about markdown syntax and realized that I can preview code on github.  
I've reviewed the Foundation content up to  the recipe project, I hav realized that redoing that simple of a project would be a waste of time so I have decided to just keep going after going over it.

## PREVIOUS TASKS

1. ~~Go over the materials~~
2. ~~Redo my first project~~

## TODO

1. Do 10 minute meditation before studying.
2. Get up to the webpage project and redo it (probably not in one sitting)

## REFLECTION

I have a good tempo going i just need to focus more on the task at hand and less at the stuff around the teaching itself.  
I believe it will come in time as I keep studying that my setup will be good enough for me to not be as distracted.
