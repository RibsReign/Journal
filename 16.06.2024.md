# Day 4

Today I went over how to make functions and how to use methods properly.

Arrow Functions
```let func = (arg1, arg2, ..., argN) => expression;```  

Ternary Operator Syntax:
```condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;```  

Function Declaration: a function, declared as a separate statement, in the main code flow:

```JS
// Function Declaration
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

Function Expression: a function, created inside an expression or inside another syntax construct. Here, the function is created on the right side of the “assignment expression” =:

```JS
// Function Expression
let sum = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};
```

A Function Expression is created when the execution reaches it and is usable only from that moment.

## REFLECTION

I've realized that now that i am going over it and using the proper tools things are going well i was only struggling because I didn't fully understand how methods worked in js not the methods themselves but the specific ones. Managed to make arrow functions out of all the functions i was making goodie.
