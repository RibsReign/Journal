# Day (13) 27.06.2024

I made the grid slider and drawing features. Project is coming along nicely and I will be done with it soon.

## PREVIOUS TASKS

1. ~~Continue with Etch-a-Sketch~~

## REPEAT TASKS

1. Meditation
2. Flexbox Zombies
3. LeetCode

## TODO

1. Change the query selector to be done by ID not by the type of element.
2. Finish the project.

## REFLECTION

I've learned that It's better to be overly specific when using query selector because when you are making an element of the same type it will just select it first and you will be confused by the behaviour and have a headache haha.
