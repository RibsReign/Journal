# Day 12 (25.06.2024)

I got started on the Etch-a-Sketch project and got the basic grid down, I've put my DOM Manipulation into practice and learned some stuff about how to scale object based on percentages, although I was not able to implement it perfectly and ended up settling on just hardcoding the size of the grid container.

## PREVIOUS TASKS

1. ~~Decide if I want to start on LeetCode ~~
2. ~~Get started on Project: Etch-a-Sketch~~

## REPEAT TASKS

1. Meditation
2. Flexbox Zombies
3. LeetCode

## TODO

1. Continue with Etch-a-Sketch

## REFLECTION

I had to rewrite this entry because of me probably not pushing correctly, It just shows I should be more careful especially when workiong with github spaces.
