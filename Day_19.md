# Day 19 (05.07.2024)

Today I was practicing more usages of array methods, it's quite fun honestly especially since it's going well and I don't feel stupid haha. I know how to debug properly now, I still need to get rid of the habit of doing everything manually and doing stuff through the JS modules, It really just makes sense.
