# Day 7
Today I redid all the Javascript Excercises needed for the module and I'm officialy caught up Yaaaay :D. I was able to breeze through them since I know now how to research for modules and how JS works compared to C. All I have to do is keep going like this every day and I'll be caught up in no time.

I've learned that remaking the codespace changes your ssh key. So I have to be careful about that I also know how to Install stufff into it now like jest. I've learned how to use node to execute code in terminal and how to use npm test to use test cases. Also learned about ... is used for when you want an input to be a string, multiple strings separated by comma or an array that is turned into an array.
