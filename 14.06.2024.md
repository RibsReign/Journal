# Day 3
Today started off good I spend a good chunk just going through materials and playing [flexbox zombies](https://mastery.games/flexboxzombies/).
I have judged that just as with previous content it's an overkill to redo the project since none of these project will be on any portfolios and they are supposed to be a learning opportunity.
So the goal is to keep going and refreshing everything i know to get myself up to speed as fast as possible and to keep myself motivated.
## [Basic data types](https://javascript.info/types#summary)
There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript.  
Seven primitive data types:  
    **number** for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±(253-1).  
    **bigint** for integer numbers of arbitrary length.  
    **string** for strings. A string may have zero or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.  
    **boolean** for true/false.  
    **null** for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null.  
    **undefined** for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined.  
    **symbol** for unique identifiers.  
And one non-primitive data type:  
    **object** for more complex data structures.
## [Basic String Methods](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_string_methods.asp)
Javascript strings are primitive and immutable: All string methods produces a new string without altering the original string.
**length**, **charAt()**, **charCodeAt()**, **at()**, **[**]**, **slice()**, **substring()**, **substr()**, **toUpperCase()**, **toLowerCase()**, 
**concat()**, **trim()**, **trimStart()**, **trimEnd()**, **padStart()**, **padEnd()**, **repeat()**, **replace()**, **replaceAll()**, **split()**
## [String Search Methods](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_string_search.asp)
**indexOf()**, **lastIndexOf()**, **match()**, **matchAll()**, **includes()**, **startsWith()**, **endsWith()**

## PREVIOUS TASKS:
