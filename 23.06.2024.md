# Day 11

Managed to finish the project in one go, even though it was just rewriting the project. I did learn how to work with branches and put the dom manipulation to use. I can see that i still have to have a lot of practice with to get used to it but that is okay.

## PREVIOUS TASKS

1. Get started on LeetCode  
2. ~~Start revisiting Rock Paper and Scissors~~

## REPEAT TASKS

1. Meditation
2. Flexbox Zombies
3. LeetCode

## TODO

1. Decide if I want to start on LeetCode  
2. Get started on Project: Etch-a-Sketch

## REFLECTION

One of these days I will have energy to also do LeetCode while doing my daily coding goal haha. But I'll think about it and maybe I'll just put it off until I finished TOP.
