# Day 27 (17.07.2024)

Some more reading not a lot of coding yet.
**irb** interactive environment  
**ruby** for executing  
**even?**  

```ruby
6.even? #=> true
7.even? #=> false
```

**odd?**  

```ruby
6.odd? #=> false
7.odd? #=> true
```

**Substrings**  
You can access strings inside strings. Stringception! Itâ€™s super easy, too.  

```ruby
"hello"[0]      #=> "h"
"hello"[0..1]   #=> "he"
"hello"[0, 4]   #=> "hell"
"hello"[-1]     #=> "o"
```

**Interpolation**  
String interpolation allows you to evaluate a string that contains placeholder variables.  

```ruby
name = "Odin"
puts "Hello, \#{name}" #=> "Hello, Odin"
puts 'Hello, \#{name}' #=> "Hello, \#{name}"
```

**Escape characters**  
Escape characters allow you to type in representations of whitespace characters and to include quotation marks inside your string without accidentally ending it. As a reminder, escape characters only work inside double quotation marks.

```ruby
\\  #=> Need a backslash in your string?
\b  #=> Backspace
\r  #=> Carriage return, for those of you that love typewriters
\n  #=> Newline. You'll likely use this one the most.
\s  #=> Space
\t  #=> Tab
\"  #=> Double quotation mark
\'  #=> Single quotation mark
```
