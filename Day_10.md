"keydown", "click".. these are events, and these are key, code, button... event properties
The Event is the base type of UIEvent which is the base type of other specific event types such as MouseEvent, TouchEvent, FocusEvent, and KeyboardEvent. Use the specific event constructor such as MouseEvent and call dispatchEvent() method on an element to generate an event from code.
Use event.isTrusted to examine whether the event is generated from code or user actions.
