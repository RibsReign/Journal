# Day 41 (09.10.2024)

I caught up to where I was before. Just have to stay consistent as I was before.  

## REFLECTION  

**Block Parameters:**  

When you see a block defined with |example1, example2|, here's what each part typically represents:  

**example1** (the first variable):  
    This is often the accumulator or result variable. It holds the current state of the accumulated value as you iterate through the collection (like a hash in your previous example).  
    In the context of reduce, this variable is updated on each iteration.  

**example2** (the second variable):  
    This represents the current element being processed from the collection. It could be an item in an array or a key-value pair from a hash, depending on what you're iterating over.  
    This variable is used within the block to perform operations on each individual element.
