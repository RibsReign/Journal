# Day 17 (02.07.2024)

Today I used **some()**, **every()**,   
**find()** - Find is like filter, but instead returns just the one you are looking for  
**findIndex()** - Find the comment with this ID  
**push(...items)** – adds items to the end  
**pop()** – extracts an item from the end  
**shift()** – extracts an item from the beginning  
**unshift(...items)** – adds items to the beginning  
The **splice** method is also able to insert the elements without any removals. For that, we need to set deleteCount to 0:

let arr = ["I", "study", "JavaScript"];

// from index 2
// delete 0
// then insert "complex" and "language"
arr.**splice**(2, 0, "complex", "language");

alert( arr ); // "I", "study", "complex", "language", "JavaScript"
